# Lessy's contributors

This document is here to thank all people who helped Lessy to be what it is. We
didn't set any rules yet in order to appear here but it will definitely not be
bound to code contributions. A user making feedbacks and/or answering to other
users' questions is as valuable as someone making code. Don't hesitate to ask
if you think you deserve to appear in this document! Even smallest
contributions are important.

If you're not sure how to contribute, please have a look to [our dedicated
document](CONTRIBUTING.md).

For the moment the list is quite short since Lessy opened its community quite
recently. [â€¦] Well, yes, I'm almost alone to work on this project for the
moment. One more good reason to join me :).

Please keep the list sorted by name.

Note I'm available to have a drink while discussing of the project. I also can
move to different cities than Grenoble (where I stay). It would be good
occasions to visit! :)

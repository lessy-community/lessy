# Backend overview

Lessy's backend is a very basic Ruby on Rails application, nothing fancy. If
you don't know about Rails, please start by their ["getting started" guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
It will guide you over all you need to know to start to help us.

Some points need a specific attention though, there are detailed in the
following documents:

- [lifecycle and state machine](lifecycle_and_state_machine.md)
- [endpoints' design](endpoints_design.md)
- [writing tests](writing_tests.md)

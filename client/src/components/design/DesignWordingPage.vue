      <h1>Wording</h1>

      <p>Wording in Lessy is extremely important. It is the way we interact
      with users and help them to accomplish their tasks. Words must be chosen
      carefully and always be supportive and inclusive.</p>

      <p>Our voice must be authentic: we do not sell a product but we build it
      to help people. It must support our <a href="https://github.com/marienfressinaud/lessy/blob/master/README.md">values</a>.

      <p>We must adapt our tone to context and user's mood. For instance, there
      are situations where user can be stressed and we have to be caring.</p>

      <p>Always try to suggest instead of telling how to do a thing. Interface
      limitations must be explained so user understands why he or she cannot
      achieve action he or she performs.</p>

      <p>Words are also important to dedramatize situations. If a user didn't
      finish any task during the day, we should not blame her or him. Instead,
      we can explain that is not dramatic and sometimes things don't happen as
      expected. Tomorrow is a new day!</p>

      <h2>Iconography</h2>

      <p>We use <a href="http://fontawesome.io/icons/">FontAwesome 4</a> as our
      default set of icons, please never use another set so interface stays
      consistent.</p>

      <p>Icon color should adapt according to the text it accompanies. In other
      words, <router-link to="/design/typography">same rules apply</router-link>.

      <p>Please always provide a text-based equivalent of icon for screen
      readers.</p>

      <h2>Illustrations, mascot and logo</h2>

      <p>We do not have any illustrations, mascot or logo yet. It is something
      we definitely want to see appear in the future though.</p>

      <p>Illustrations are a very powerful tool to encourage users when they
      are frustrated or lost. They also help to introduce a new feature. Mascot
      could bring a touch of humour and be supportive. Logo reflects identity
      of Lessy. In short, these tools are an essential part of what Lessy is
      (or could be).</p>

      <p>If you have any illustration skill, we would love <a href="https://github.com/lessy-community/lessy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">
      to hear about you</a>!</p>

# Lessy

Lessy is a time manager application built upon strong principles. It is
designed to be as **intuitive and inclusive** as possible. Its goal is to
return people their **power to manage time**, instil **self-confidence** and
challenge their **capacity to question themselves**. It is built by a **diverse
and welcoming community**.

Every feature we develop, every discussion we have, every decision we make MUST
support this vision.

*Note: interface will change quite soon, follow the work of [the corresponding
iteration](https://github.com/marienfressinaud/lessy/projects/3) if you're
interested.*

We want Lessy to be very different of other "project managers" or "todo-list
applications".

Compared to Todoist, Trello, Wunderlist and all similar commercial applications,
Lessy is built by a non-commercial community. It means that all decisions are
made by users for the users. Money never appears in this equation!

Lessy is not only different from a commercial point of view, it is also
different compared to the vast majority of other free softwares. Indeed, by
making our goal explicit, we try to solve a specific problem. It means we
cannot accept contributions that doesn't match the vision we have of the
project.

Our bet is that will **make Lessy better over the long-term**.

More specifically, Lessy will help you:

- To collect ideas you have in mind.
- To organize these ideas in projects and/or tasks depending on their
  complexity.
- To identify what's important to do at the present moment.

## Getting started

If you simply want to start to use Lessy, just **go to [lessy.io](https://lessy.io)**
and create an account.

If you want to **report a bug or suggest a feature**, you'll have to create an
account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) first. Then, you'll be able to create
an "issue" on our [bugtracker](https://github.com/marienfressinaud/lessy/issues/).
Bugtrackers are usually used to report bugs only, but since we never found a
satisfying tool to support community's discussions, we use it for every kind of
discussion.

You might be interested to know **what will be next big features** of Lessy. We
do not maintain any official roadmap. However, we are using small iterations to
plan future work. An iteration is represented by a GitHub project and it groups
a set of related features or technical issues. [Have a look to current
iterations](https://github.com/marienfressinaud/lessy/projects)! Note that
iterations are named after [constellations' name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/88_modern_constellations)
to remind us to look at the stars sometimes.

If you're an advanced user, you may prefer to **host Lessy on your own server**.
That's the prefered option if you care about your data and we're totally OK
with it. That's the reason we try to maintain [documentation to install Lessy](https://github.com/marienfressinaud/lessy/blob/master/docs/production_environment.md)
in production up-to-date.

## Community

Community is so important to us that it appears in our vision (detailled in
introduction of this document). Community is part of Lessy. We cannot make a
useful and used application without the implication of people that are
different from us. We want to work as a **diverse and inclusive community**.

Contribution to the project is opened to everyone as long as our vision makes
sense to you. You can start by reading our **[contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.
Our ground rules are detailled in our **[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**,
we strongly encourage you to read it.

Also, all contributors are listed in our [contributors file](CONTRIBUTORS.md),
it can be interested to better know who you might be working with if you join
us! This file is also a way to thanks every person that took of their time to
contribute in a way or another.
